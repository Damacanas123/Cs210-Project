# Cs210-Project

In the group project for this course, on state basis we investigated the  relation between the death counts in traffic accidents and temperature, precipitation, usage of seatbelts in USA. Seatbelt usage decreases the death count, precipitation has no obvious effect on deaths and lastly as temperature increases people go on travelling more and therefore death counts increase.
